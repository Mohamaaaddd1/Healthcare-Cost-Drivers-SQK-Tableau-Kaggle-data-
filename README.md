# US Medical Healthcare Cost Drivers: SQL + Tableau Case Study
This project explores the drivers of individual healthcare costs using a U.S. insurance dataset. SQL is used to perform in-depth analytics with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), while Tableau brings the findings to life with an interactive dashboard.

The analysis highlights how lifestyle choices (smoking, BMI), demographics (age, dependents, sex), and geography (region) influence medical costs. This mirrors the type of work done in healthcare analytics, insurance risk assessment, and policy planning.
## ‚ùì Key Questions Answered:
What lifestyle factors are the biggest cost drivers in healthcare?

* Do smokers pay significantly more than non-smokers?

* How does obesity (BMI ‚â• 30) affect medical spending?

* Is there a ‚Äúhealthy baseline‚Äù for BMI groups?

How do healthcare costs evolve with age?

* Which age groups contribute most to total healthcare costs?

* Do costs rise steadily or accelerate at certain life stages?

Do family dynamics play a role in medical charges?

* Are larger families (more dependents) associated with higher average spending?

* Is there a cost efficiency or burden spread across families?

Are there geographic disparities in U.S. healthcare costs?

* Which regions face higher average charges?

* Do certain regions have lower or more stable costs?

How do population-level KPIs help summarize overall risk?

* What is the average cost per patient?

* What are the extremes (min & max charges)?

* How much variation (std. dev) exists in patient costs?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
SQL (aggregation, grouping, CTEs, KPIs, CASE statements)
Tableau (interactive dashboarding, KPI cards, maps, bar/line/scatter plots)
GitHub (documentation & version control)

## üìà Results:
Smokers pay ~2‚Äì3x more than non-smokers.
Healthcare costs rise steeply after age 50.
Obese patients average significantly higher charges.
Family size modestly affects costs.
Regional differences are present, with the Southeast showing higher averages.
