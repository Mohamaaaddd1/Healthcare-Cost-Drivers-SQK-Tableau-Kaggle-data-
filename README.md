# US Medical Healthcare Cost Drivers: SQL + Tableau Case Study
This project explores individual-level healthcare costs using SQL and Tableau, based on a U.S. medical insurance dataset. The goal is to identify key cost drivers (age, smoking, obesity, family size, and geography) and communicate insights with a healthcare-analytics-ready dashboard. The data includes 1338 rows along with 7 columns.
## Key Questions Answered:
How much more expensive are smokers compared to non-smokers?
How do costs increase with age?
What is the financial impact of obesity?
Do families with more children face higher healthcare costs?
Are there regional disparities in average costs?

## Tools Used:
SQL for aggregation, grouping, and exploratory analysis.
Tableau for an interactive dashboard highlighting cost drivers.
